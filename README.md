# 3D
This folder contains some general pourpose 3d projects. 
## Taranis tray v1
This is the first version of the Taranis x9d plus Tray. This tray is meant to be mounted with screws on the Taranis shell. In the folder you will also find the handles for the M4 hex bolt to be used to mount the tray.
To make it dismountable, I mounted a threaded insert into the taranis shell instead of using nuts.
## Taranis tray v2
This is the second version of the Taranis x9d plus Tray. This tray is meant to be fast unmountable. In the folder you will also find the cilinders to mount on the taranis shell, where the tray will be inserted.
This is a video where is shown how to mount and dismount the tray:

# devices
This folder contains the projects of electronics devices.
## FPC_latencyMeasure
This is a small circuit designed to measure the latency time of an FPV video system. In particular, this device is designed to measure the so-called "glass to glass" latency, the time that passes from when the image is sampled by the camera to when it is displayed on the screen. It is important to keep the latency low on the FPV systems because it introduces a delay between the command given to the vehicle and the sight of the effect that the command has produced, this greatly affects the maneuverability of, for example, a drone or an airplane.
