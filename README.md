# 3D
This folder contains some general pourpose 3d projects. 
## Taranis tray v1
This is the first version of the Taranis x9d plus Tray. This tray is meant to be mounted with screws on the Taranis shell. In the folder you will also find the handles for the M4 hex bolt to be used to mount the tray.
To make it dismountable, I mounted a threaded insert into the taranis shell instead of using nuts.
## Taranis tray v2
This is the second version of the Taranis x9d plus Tray. This tray is meant to be fast unmountable. In the folder you will also find the cilinders to mount on the taranis shell, where the tray will be inserted.
This is a video where is shown how to mount and dismount the tray:
